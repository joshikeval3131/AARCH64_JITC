# Objective 

This project is a tool which can be used to do just in time compilation and execution using GDB and QEMU. 
It contains QEMU builds for AARCH64 and standard GDB along with this tool can be use to inject Assembly instruction 
at runtime. This is very helpful while debugging Source code. This tool is very helpful for following scenarios.

1. When you want to inject some instruction while debugging which will alter the normal flow of program 
2. If you want to develop a quick algorithm in Assembly language .  

The other objective of this tool is to learn AARCH64 and learn about an OG debugger tool GDB with hands on experiments. 
Knowing ways around these tools will help in longer run to an Embedded software developer. 

One good thing about GDB is that this is a universal tool and almost all CPUs and arch will support this. 
Learning this tool can be very useful. One can also make my universal development env for any SOC/CPU with the help of 
GDB. Let this be the long term goal to use GDB :) :+1. 

## prerequisite checklist for this project 

1. [ ] Learn complete AARCH64. Go through learn the arch docs from ARM. 
2. [ ] Setup and learn about QEMU for AARCH64 and read about GDB. 
3. [ ] Experiment with GDB to learn about ways on how to use it very efficiently. 
4. [ ] Setup a startup code for AARCH64 and tool-chain to execute programs on it using C.
